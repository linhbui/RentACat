RentACat
========

I haven't touched a cat for so long that I have became cat-deprived... Unfortunately KitTea is not yet open (though they said they would in Summer 2014!). Instead of daydreaming about cuddling with cats, I decided to build a Rails app for renting cats from other people.

Features:
- Browse through all the cats (of course with pictures!)
- Secure user log in/log out with BCrypt
- Protected from CSRF
- Preseve log in sessions
- Users can delete their own requests
- Owners can approve/deny requests for their cats
- Check for overlapping requests
- Bootstrap layout
